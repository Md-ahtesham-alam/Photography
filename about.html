          <p>
            I’m passionate about capturing the beauty in everyday moments — from
            serene natural landscapes to the vibrant life of the streets. My
            photography is driven by curiosity and a deep appreciation for light,
            texture, and emotion. Whether it's the quiet stillness of a sunrise or
            the spontaneous charm of candid life, I aim to freeze those moments in
            time and tell stories that words alone cannot express.
          </p>

        Most of my work is captured using a mobile camera, proving that
        creativity knows no limits. Each photo is a reflection of how I see the
        world — raw, real, and inspiring.

      <div class="thank">
          Thank you for visiting. I hope my photos spark a connection, a memory, or
          simply a moment of pause.
